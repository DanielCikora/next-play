            Welcome to <strong>NextPlay</strong> - a personal game store project
            created and designed by me, Daniel Cikora. This project is for
            portfolio and educational purposes only.
          </p>
          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold'>1. Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            NextPlay does not collect, store, or share any personal information
            from users. This site does not use forms, cookies, tracking,
            analytics, or third-party services that gather data. It&apos;s just
            a frontend demo (with a publicly available API for free games) â€” no
            backend, no database, no funny business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data fetched from the external API is used in real-time and not
            stored or processed in any way by NextPlay itself.
          </p>
          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold'>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>NextPlay name, logo, and custom design elements</strong>{" "}
            are original creations and are owned by me. Please{" "}
            <strong>do not copy, use, or redistribute</strong> the logo or
            design without permission.

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold'>3. No Commercial Intent</h2>
          <p>
            This website is a personal portfolio project intended to showcase
            frontend development skills using technologies like React, Next.js,
            and Tailwind CSS. It is <strong>not</strong> a real store, and no
            products are being sold here.
          </p>
          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold'>4. External Links</h2>

            operated by me. I have no control over their content or privacy
            practices, and visiting them is at your own discretion.
